I'm working on a solo project of sentiment analysis of public opinions on the blockchain approach for carbon credit markets on Twitter. 

### Porject Description 

The project's goals were to analyze tweets in English that can help understand public opinion on blockchain and its role in the transition to a net-zero economy around the world and find possible correlations between the geo-political and demographical background of those Tweets. For that purpose, various unsupervised approaches were used and evaluated.
